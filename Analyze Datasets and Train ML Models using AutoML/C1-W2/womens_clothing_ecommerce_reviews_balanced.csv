-1,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.,Blouses
-1,I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d,Blouses
-1,I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!  unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam! i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt!,Blouses
-1,This top runs super small in the upper arms  shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem  the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10  12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...,Blouses
-1,"I bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on",Blouses
-1,I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,Blouses
-1,"The shirt is beautiful  but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders  and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium  and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",Blouses
-1,Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(,Blouses
-1,I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise  the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric.    though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also  it,Blouses
0,I really wanted to like this shirt  but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all.,Blouses
0,"This top looks adorable in the product photos  so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off  but like another reviewer said  i found it to be like a tent on me  billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress  but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4""  120 lbs and tried the xs.",Blouses
0,I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--  the description said it was black and white.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short  and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.,Blouses
0,I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis,Blouses
0,After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo,Blouses
0,The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes)  but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though  because it's a pretty shirt and different.,Blouses
0,I have mixed feelings about htis top  it is a nice shape and comfortable  fits triue t o size  but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs  3-dd chest).,Blouses
1,I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but  a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy  but it does fit. so  if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose  imho you can size down.    the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th,Blouses
1,Definitely size down it does run large however  it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.,Blouses
1,I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.,Blouses
1,I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.,Blouses
1,This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!,Blouses
1,Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white  flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!,Blouses
1,This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.,Blouses
1,Fits true to size and has a great shape. i get compliments each time i wear it  glad i purchased it.,Blouses
1,"I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it ""might"" be sort of cute. a comfy  flowy  warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room  including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store  and it still looked great! it is comfortable  loose  and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr",Blouses
-1,On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.,Dresses
-1,"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me  but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size  they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",Dresses
-1,The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,Dresses
-1,Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great,Dresses
-1,I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.,Dresses
-1,This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large  arm holes are very low.  not flattering.,Dresses
-1,Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.,Dresses
-1,It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.,Dresses
-1,Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!,Dresses
0,This dress is beautiful but the bottom half was too tight for my shape.,Dresses
0,I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top,Dresses
0,I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!,Dresses
0,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.,Dresses
0,Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.,Dresses
0,Haven't decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams  but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect  however  the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.  dress looks exactly as in the picture.,Dresses
0,I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did  it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.    very bummed  but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers,Dresses
0,"I loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered. the length was good for me (only 5'4""). the elastic top fit well (32b) but then from there it was too much fabric. i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight a-line but it was just a huge amount of fabric on me...several inches on both sides big. i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf",Dresses
0,I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres,Dresses
1,I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale.,Dresses
1,"The retailer stylist had showed me this on my way out of the fitting room and i'm so glad she did. i went back in to try it on and loved it!! it almost has a ""spanx"" like stretch to the material which perfectly keeps its shape and is so well made. i also really liked the open part in the back because it adds an extra something to the dress but you can still wear a strapless bra if you desire. i plan on wearing it at the beach on the 4th of july:-)",Dresses
1,Cute and comfortable. paired with tights and boots for work  will also look cute with flats or sandals in the spring. the fabric is a nice weigh  not too flimsy. might be a bit short on a taller gal.,Dresses
1,I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color  i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however  once i saw this dress in-store  i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made  the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it,Dresses
1,I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store  tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.,Dresses
1,This dress is slightly tight on me and i usually wear petite 00 or xxs (5'1 100 lbs) the quality of the fabric is thick and texture  colors are just like the photo  and it has a nice satin like underlining in a dark navy. the snug fit of the dress makes it so i don't need a bra  which is nice especially for a day dress !,Dresses
1,"As other reviews noted  this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality  but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7""  and if i were any less  i don't think this would work for me at all.",Dresses
1,"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2""  medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite  the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down.",Dresses
1,"If it's a knock off  its of the ""poise"" dress  and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!",Dresses
-1,On me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9  34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.,Fine gauge
-1,"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!",Fine gauge
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !,Fine gauge
-1,Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,Fine gauge
-1,Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front  bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!,Fine gauge
-1,The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t,Fine gauge
-1,This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.,Fine gauge
0,"This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small.",Fine gauge
0,This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also  the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath  it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you  buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.,Fine gauge
0,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5""  125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",Fine gauge
0,Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.,Fine gauge

0,This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still,Fine gauge
0,"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2""  115lbs  32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it  o well.",Fine gauge

1,I ordered this top in all 3 colors  love the peplum.look..  returned the green  which is actually my fav color but it wasn't a pretty shade of green and i don't think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream   especially going into spring/summer..  kept the yellow and the navy and love..  the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.  it's a very cute top  runs a little large  but is very pretty.,Fine gauge

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates

-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
1,This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it  but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute  but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.,Intimates

1,Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!,Intimates
1,I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing  i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather,Intimates
1,I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.,Intimates
1,Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs  etc.)   you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.,Intimates

1,Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size  i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!,Intimates
1,This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine  but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support  especially for an unlined bra  and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.,Intimates
-1,This is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.,Jackets
-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu,Jackets
-1,The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.,Jackets
-1,The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.,Jackets
-1,This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.,Jackets
-1,This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i,Jackets

-1,I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts  but this way too high  and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall  slender person  but it's definitely not right for my short  curvy body. returning it today.,Jackets
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.,Jackets
0,The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans  black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,The jacket is cute  it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.,Jackets
0,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,Jackets
0,When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight  too boxy.,Jackets
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,Jackets
0,I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!,Jackets
1,I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress  skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!,Jackets
1,I bought this vest to add more versatility to my wardrobe. i love it! i got it in navy  and since it is one color  it goes with a lot of different things - tanks  long sleeves  short sleeves  pants/skirts  etc. i like the bow in the back and the vest makes a plain outfit look much more elegant and exciting! the vest itself is a little longer than i would have liked.,Jackets
1,"-like others  i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many  many outfits. it is really well-constructed  classic  comfortable  and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats  i'm rather tall at 5'9""  so it's hard to find",Jackets
1,I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented  it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!,Jackets
1,This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected  but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.,Jackets
1,Great coat! lightweight  oversized  yet warm. just enough structure to flatter most body types. i wear an xl/14  but got medium as it's very oversized. light enough to wear with layers. got a million compliments!,Jackets
1,Love this jacket!!! it is soooo soft and goes with everything. you will want to wear it every day. loved it so much i bought my mother one  too.,Jackets
1,Love  love  love this jacket! i'm able to dress it up or casual. the hint from a review i read to button the lapels back worked awesome. good quality  has a bit of stretch for bulky shirt to wear underneath. would definitely recommend if like the military jacket style.,Jackets
1,"This jacket is the best. i'm trying to step up my work wardrobe game while still maintaining some personality and this blazer fits the bill. it's soft  structured  and best part: the hoodie insert is removable. for reference  i'm 5'4""  128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.",Jackets
-1,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.,Jeans
-1,I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(,Jeans
-1,I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.,Jeans
-1,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that,Jeans
-1,I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.,Jeans
-1,I really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.,Jeans
-1,I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.,Jeans
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely,Jeans
-1,I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time,Jeans
0,Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.,Jeans
0,These jeans fit perfectly. however  the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.,Jeans
0,Great jeans by pilcro  too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.,Jeans
0,These were very nice  but had to return. i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt. these were tight in those places and big in the waist ,Jeans
0,These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.,Jeans
0,I liked the cut and color. seemed like good quality. i'm 5'5 and theses were so long. i had to fold them up like 6 inches not to step in them,Jeans
0,I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore  so i bought 27r  knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better  and it fits a tad loose ev,Jeans
0,These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.,Jeans
0,I really wanted to like these. they're soft  long enough for 5'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;(,Jeans
1,These tight cords are perfect for fall.,Jeans
1,Love these jeans! they fit great  they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.,Jeans
1,These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties  i love the rise  and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine haven't stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had)  and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact.,Jeans
1,Normally a 28  and on a fluke i dragged the 27 to the fitting room. the 27 hung better that the 28.  i have a belly  but not much in the hips  so this was surprising. most things are too tight in the waist.  denim feels very soft. they may not last  but it's like butter.,Jeans
1,I normally wear a size 27  but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite  but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle  but i have very skinny calves and ankles  so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.,Jeans
1,I am obsessed with these jeans! i have them in 3 washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now. they are truly the perfect skinny jeans. you can dress them up with heels and a cute top  or down with a slouchy sweater and boots  or even throw on with a simple tee and flats. i love that they are low rise  as i am short waisted  and often find the front rise too long on many styles. the backside is also super flattering  and the back pockets are the perfect size and shape...no,Jeans
1,I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.,Jeans
1,Love the fit of pilcro jeans. it's always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesn't show off lumps and bumps! these are terrific quality indeed.,Jeans
1,I was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional 40% off  making them a fabulous deal. they are nicely made  and the shade of blue is very pretty. my only complaint  and the reason i'm on the fence is that they are so big. i usually buy a 31 in the ag stevie jeans  occasionally a 32  so i figured i'd be safe sizing down to a 30. wrong. i could have gone to a 29  and possibly even a 28....they're that big! i do like them though  and may just try shrinking them in the dryer.,Jeans
-1,This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.,Knits
-1,I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide  short  and crooked. after it was washed once  it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.,Knits
-1,I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.,Knits
-1,This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.,Knits
-1,Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however  the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.,Knits
-1,As a beach cover-up this would be great  but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.,Knits
-1,I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.,Knits
-1,Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock,Knits
-1,It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.,Knits
0,Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.,Knits
0,I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine  the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.,Knits
0,The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture  plain black. the back print is nice just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.,Knits
0,"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8""  180lbs  36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",Knits
0,I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings  but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.,Knits
0,I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric  no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms  might work for you. sending it back.,Knits
0,This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees  size down. xs works good for me.,Knits
0,This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust  with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice  the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me  but it may lay better on a different body type.,Knits
0,The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.,Knits

1,I was so happy to find this in extra small. it is such a cute loose fitting top.. very soft and flowy tank. the orange color is so pretty. i went down a size in this top,Knits
1,This is a great  effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.,Knits
1,I haven't taken this off since i got it. and since then  i've ordered two more colors. it's definitely sheer  but the blue isn't see-through  though i expect the lighter colors are. it is a distressed look  but super-soft  comfy  and perfect to wear over work out clothes or dressed up with jeans. really a nice summer top for hot days. i'm 5'4  135 the and the xxs is perfect--drapey  but not baggy. very flattering straps too.,Knits
1,Bought this tank on a whim  but i'm so happy i did! so flattering  comfy and well made.,Knits
-1,I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.,Layering
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,Layering
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,Layering
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.",Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
1,Noce color as well  only gave one less star due to thin you could see my bra quality (it was pink and i tried on the grey). otherwise  nice and soft. regular size a little long and long sleeves  but sold out n petite :-(,Layering
1,The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,Layering
1,I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming  and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned  and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also  it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!,Layering
1,"If your looking for a nice quality basic tee  this is it. nothing special  but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2""  35a/b bust  28 waist  39 hips.",Layering
1,I bought the black one on an extra 40% off sale and i just love it! not thrilled about the other colors  but i might order another one just because i like it so much. super soft and comfy. i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out  but i like the way it fits. not too big at all.,Layering

-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,Legwear
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear

-1,I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.,Legwear

0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,Legwear
0,"I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm  soft and super comfortable. however  they stretch out a lot  as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house  but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable  but beware how much they stretch.

0,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,Pants

0,Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!,Pants

0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts

0,"Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom",Shorts

0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts

0,I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me  which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back  in side two layers  and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.  i'll probably wear them again  but i'm not totally thrilled by them.,Shorts
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts
1,"I find this romper looks much more crisp on the picure than in real life. i find it more slouchier and shapeless even though i went with my ""smaller size"". the material is very soft  but thin  that is maybe the reason. i am not sure if i am going to keep. i wanted a bit more stunning look for my money. not saying this might be a great romper for somebody else however",Shorts

1,Retailer rarely disappoints and this jumpsuit is a perfect example! i ordered a small based on reviews that it runs large and i do not like tight shorts and it was the right decision. the fabric  design and overall style make this piece easy to dress up or down. i cant wait to wear it. if you are on the fence order it now because this will not last long.,Shorts

1,I like the idea of a skort  and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!,Shorts
1,I listened to the other reviewers and ordered down...silly of me! all plcro seem to run a bit large and do stretch out. i got the 25 in the lovely light grey...fit me  but too tight to be comfy. i usually wear a 25 26  or 27 in jeans depending on the style. unfortunately  there are now no more in the grey...too bad. this shouldn't happen at the beginning of the season....please please please bring them back in this great neutral color or a stone.....,Shorts

-1,While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must.

-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,Skirts
0,Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4  but have curvy hips  so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn't even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line  but it's fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall  cute design  but not for me.,Skirts
0,Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.,Skirts
0,I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric  but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.,Skirts
0,I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.,Skirts
0,I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well  bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm  but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going,Skirts
0,So i was super excited to get this skirt  unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured  it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier  i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re,Skirts

0,I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!,Sweaters
0,I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.,Sweaters
0,I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough  unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well  rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut  great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!,Sweaters
0,It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy,Sweaters
0,I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness  simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles  pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it  consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.,Sweaters
0,Going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit. petite size would have fit better  but was sold out.,Sweaters
0,Unfortunately  this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also  the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.,Sweaters
0,This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms  or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms  this top may not be for you.,Sweaters
1,I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight  it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body  which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y,Sweaters
1,Like another reviewer  i was in the store looking for the vest with the faux fur collar and tie-waist. it turned out to be too long/bulky for my small frame  or there wasn't an xs (can't recall)  but i saw this and it's just the thing i didn't even know i needed. i'm fairly thin and petite at 5'4 and drown in most cardigans. this is just long enough. it was a subtle a-line shape. fabric is not thick but is substantial enough that it's still warm. i also like that it's hand washable  nice to have,Sweaters
1,Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen  cotton  and acrylic  so it's not heavy  it's weighty. anyways  it seemed to run large just due to gravity  so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.,Sweaters
1,I was pleasantly surprised when i tried on this sweater. it is well made and fit perfect. the will really enjoy weather this in the fall.,Sweaters
1,"Love the look of this poncho - which is not as large/billowy as i thought it would be. i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love. the colors are more beige than gray  for those of you with pale/blue underdone complexions. it may wash you out. love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop. i'm 5'9""/132 pounds  and the hem was a bit cropped on me. may want to consider a tank top or t-shirt underneath.",Sweaters
1,I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess  i want to buy two more just in case!,Sweaters
1,"I purchased this jacket in a pxs  as i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight  which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips.       there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem  which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed  giving it a comfy sweater feel. there's also two zippered pockets  whic",Sweaters
1,Love love love!!! it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable!! it does run at least a size or 2 big!! i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store. was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on!!  great sweater for fall/winter,Sweaters
1,Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work  with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape  with the large wing like sleeves  makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold  you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though  i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and won't be don't a ton of moving aro,Sweaters
-1,I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit  so i went for this one. unfortunately  the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom  is squared off  not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.,Swim
-1,Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.,Swim
-1,This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.,Swim
-1,I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.,Swim
-1,I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.,Swim
-1,I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are,Swim
-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,Swim
-1,Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.,Swim
-1,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Swim
0,I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.,Swim
0,"I have this suit in the ""tile"" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the ""mint"" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the ""v"" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result  my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad  because the",Swim
0,I love the design of this and the pattern! it's comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming. i like a bit more coverage  the front has great coverage but on the side... whoa!!!,Swim
0,I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde,Swim
0,I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge ,Swim
0,I love this swimsuit - the color  the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me  but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that  although the backside looks great  there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit  this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.,Swim
0,Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.,Swim
0,"I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute  however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5""4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also  for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back.",Swim

1,I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy  and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd)  so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews,Swim
1,I bought a suit similar to this last year  and loved it! this year i bought the pineapple print  and it is beautiful (size 2). it is classy/sexy. i have a long torso  so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on. i highly recommend this product!,Swim

-1,I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.,Trend

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
0,This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large  i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so  but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe  though  is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled  the background color of this skirt is not even close to,Trend
